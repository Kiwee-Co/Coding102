# Coding102

## Outline
This coding class is a continuation of our [Coding101](https://github.com/Kiwee-Co/Coding101) class.  

Since we discussed Java basis last semester, this semester we are going to focus on data structure.  We will discuss [Arrays and Lists](01.Arrays_and_Lists/) again with more details, [Stacks and Queues](02.Stacks_and_Queues/) to understand some basic FIFO/FILO concepts, [Trees](03.Trees/) to understand some variation of trees.  After that, we will discuss basic [Graphs](04.Graphs/) and its traversal; finally, before we start working on the term project like last semester, we are going to discuss [hashing and maps](05.Hashing_and_Maps/) and its appplication.  

As for the final project, we will have two weeks to discuss possible project ideas and how we are going to divide and conquer the projects.  I hope this is going to be a fun and rewarding semester for all of you.

### Term Project Demo - "Maze Solver Game"
  - Students create a game where characters navigate through a maze.
  - Implement maze generation and solving algorithms using graph structures.
  - Encourage creativity in designing characters, obstacles, and the overall theme.
  - Introduce challenges that require understanding stacks, queues, and other data structures learned throughout the course.
