# Coding102

## Outline
This coding class is a continuation of our [Coding101](https://github.com/Kiwee-Co/Coding101) class.  

Since we discussed Java basis last semester, this semester we are going to focus on data structure.  We will discuss [Arrays and Lists](01.Arrays_and_Lists/) again with more details, [Stacks and Queues](02.Stacks_and_Queues/) to understand some basic FIFO/FILO concepts, [Trees](03.Trees/) to understand some variation of trees.  

After that, we are going to discuss [hashing and maps](04.Hashing_and_Maps/) and its appplication and leave us sometime for term project.

I hope this is going to be a fun and rewarding semester for all of you.
